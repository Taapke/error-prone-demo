# Spotbugs Demo
This is a demo project to illustrate how to use ErrorProne for static code analysis in Java projects. ErrorProne helps detect common Java mistakes at compile-time, providing feedback to improve code quality.## Getting started
Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* Apache Maven

## Installation
Clone the repository:
``git clone https://github.com/Taapke/error-prone-demo``
``cd error-prone-demo``

``mvn compile``
or
run main

## Usage
After running the commands, ErrorProne will analyze the code during the compilation phase and report any issues directly in the console output.
## Configuration
ErrorProne can be configured by modifying the pom.xml file. You can specify the checks and their severity according to your needs.
